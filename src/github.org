* What is Git?
- Git is a "Distributed Version Control System" (DCVS)
- It is the tool RoboJackets uses to collaborate on code
- Git tracks changes made to files in your project, and handles combining
  these changes
** What is Github?
- Github is a publically hosted git server
- It hosts our projects as "repositories" on the internet
- This saves us the hassle of hosting a server for fellow RoboJackets to
  obtain copies of the code
- As you matriculate through tech, you'll be building an online portfolio of
  your work on github.
