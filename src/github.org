* What is Git?
- Git is a "Distributed Version Control System" (DCVS)
- It is the tool RoboJackets uses to collaborate on code
- Git tracks changes made to files in your project, and handles merging
  these changes
- Working on different parts of code and then combining them creates unique challenges that
  cannot be handled by file sharing systems like DropBox and Google Drive

* What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a publically hosted git server
- It hosts our projects as "repositories" on the internet
- This saves us the hassle of hosting a server for fellow RoboJackets to
  obtain copies of the code
- As you matriculate through Tech, you'll be building an online portfolio of
  your work on GitHub.

* How do you find things on GitHub?
- Repositories are stored at https://github.com/<ORG-OR-USER-NAME>/<REPO-NAME>
- So all of our projects can be found at https://github.com/RoboJackets
- Your personal projects will exist at https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>

** Create a GitHub account
- [[https://github.com/join%0A][https://github.com/join]]
- Please include /at least/ your real first name
# Emphasize this requirement is for display name on GitHub, not username

* Fork and star our repo
- Navigate to github.com/robojackets/robocup-software
    - Or the repo of whatever RoboJackets team you are on

* What is a fork?
- Problem: How do I try something out on a project without affecting the project itself?
- Solution: Forks!
- A fork is a copy of a repository that exists on your personal account
- Changes made on a fork will not affect the original repository, and vice versa
- Your fork is present on https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/robocup-software

* Install Git on your computer
- Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Mac OS: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
- Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux

* Git Config
- These commands set up git to attribute your contributions to our code to you.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your@email.here"
  #+END_SRC

* Let's grab some code!
- Go back to the webpage for our GitHub repository
- Select the clone button, then copy the link displayed

** Clone the repository
- In your terminal navigate to your workspace

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone <PASTE-CLIPBOARD-CONTENTS-HERE>
#+END_SRC

- Tada! Your own working copy of RoboJackets code!

** Adding Remotes
- These commands set you up to push to your fork by default, and still be able to receive updates.

# Emphasize that the brackets are to be replaced
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~/<REPOSITORY-FOLDER>
  git remote add rj https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software.git
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/robocup-software.git
  git remote -v

  # You can find the link in the last command under the 'clone or download'
  # green button on your FORK
#+END_SRC

** Checking Remotes
Now when you do:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git remote -v
#+END_SRC
You should see:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/robocup-software.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/robocup-software.git (push)
rj  https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software.git (fetch)
rj  https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software.git (push)
#+END_SRC
