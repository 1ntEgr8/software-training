* What is Git?
- Git is a "Distributed Version Control System" (DCVS)
- It is the tool RoboJackets uses to collaborate on code
- Git tracks changes made to files in your project, and handles merging
  these changes

** What is Github?
- Github is a publically hosted git server
- It hosts our projects as "repositories" on the internet
- This saves us the hassle of hosting a server for fellow RoboJackets to
  obtain copies of the code
- As you matriculate through tech, you'll be building an online portfolio of
  your work on github.

* How do you find things on Github?
- Repositories are stored at https://github.com/"OrganizationName"/"RepoName"
- So all of our projects can be found at https://github.com/RoboJackets

** Create a Github account
- [[https://github.com/join%0A][https://github.com/join]]
- Please include /at least/ your real first name

* Fork and star our repo
- RoboJackets/robocup-software (http://bit.ly/1L70JbB)

* Install Git on your computer
# todo

* Git Config
- These commands set up git to attribute your contributions to our code to you.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your@email.here"
  #+END_SRC

* Let's grab some code!
- Navigate to github.com/robojackets/roboracing-software
    - Or the repo of whatever RoboJackets team you are on
- Select the clone button, and then select download

- TODO: Put a picture of an arrow pointing to the top right

** Clone the repository
- In your terminal navigate to your workspace

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone <PASTE_CLIPBOARD_CONTENTS_HERE>
#+END_SRC

- Tada! Your own working copy of RoboJackets code!

** Adding Remotes
- These commands set you up to push to your fork by default, and still be able to receive updates.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~/<REPOSITORY_FOLDER>
  git remote add rj https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software.git
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GH_USERNAME>/robocup-software.git
  git remote -v

  # You can find the link in the last command under the 'clone or download'
  # green button on your FORK
#+END_SRC
