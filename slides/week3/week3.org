* TODO Needs speaker notes

* What are we doing today?
- Data structures and algorithms in C++
- Brancing and merging in Git

* What's a constructor?
- A special type of function that instantiates a class
- Basically, it sets up an object and returns it

* What's a container?
- An object you can use to store other objects
- They can be ordered, associative, both, or neither
  - *Ordered:* The contents are in a specific order
  - *Associative:* Two objects are associated with each other within the container
- TODO am I missing any important properties here? I want to say "uniqueness" or something...

* Common containers
| =array= | a static-length ordered list of objects |
| =vector= | a dynamic-length ordered list of objects |
| =set= | an ordered group of unique objects |
| =map= | an ordered group of key-value pairs, with unique keys|

* Arrays
| =at= | returns the value at a specific index |
| =front= | returns the first item |
| =back= | returns the last item |
| =size= | returns the number of elements |

* Vectors
- Everything from the last slide, and...
| =clear= | removes all items |
| =insert= | inserts an item at a specific index |
| =push_back= | adds a given element to the end |
| =pop_back= | removes the last element |

* Iterators
-

* Algorithms
- All of these can be restricted to a range in the container
| =sort= | sorts a container |
| =count= | counts the number of items in a container that match a given item |
| =find= | returns an iterator to the first element that matches a given item |
| =copy= | copies elements from one container to another |
| =fill= | fills a container with copies of a given element |
| =accumulate= | sums all elements in a container |
| =iota= | fills a container with sequentially increasing values |
