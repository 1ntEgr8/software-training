* Codepad
- Today we will be using codepad to write code in
  - This is a remote interview tool
- go to [[https://codepad.remoteinterview.io]]

* Change to C++ The superior language

* Hello World!
- Add *World!* to your code
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

* Click Run

* C++ code layout
- line 1: inclues a header file (covered later)
- line 4: defines the main function
- line 6: tells the computer that the program ran successfully
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

* {}
- Curly Braces define scope in the code
- Right now that means that your code goes
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  int main() {
    // <==== HERE =====
  }
#+END_SRC

* ;
- A semicolon defines the end of a line of code
- Think of it like a period in a sentence
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  int main() {
    doSomething;
  }
#+END_SRC

* Looking back at Hello World!
- out code is in {}
- *cout* tells the computer to write the letters to the screen
- *<<* tells the computer what to write out
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
  }
#+END_SRC

* Most useful program ever
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  int main() {
    cout << 2 + 2;
  }
#+END_SRC

* Variables
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ -n
  int main() {
    int my_var = 2;
    cout << my_var + my_var;
  }
#+END_SRC

* Primitive Variables Types
- What makes a variable primitive
| Name | Description |
|-------+------|
| =bool= | Can be either *true* or *false*|
| =char= | A number from -128 to 127 or a letter character like c or + (on the keyboard)|
| =int= | Any whole number from -2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647|
| =double= | any number from 2.2e-308 to 1.8e+308 with decimals|

* Primitive Variables?

- But Actually... It means that it cannot be split into parts

* Non Primitives we will be using today
| Name | Description |
|-------+------|
| =string= | Contains text|

* Questions??
- Still more to come...
- Let's write some code

* If Statements
- What *IF* I only want to execute code sometimes?
