* Merge Conflicts
- Two weeks ago, we talked about branches and how they can be used to avoid
  conflicts in the code
- But sometimes, multiple people edit the same file on the same branch. Git's
  powerful, but it's not magic.
- A merge conflict occurs when you try to push code based on an old version
  of the software that conflicts with changes in the same files already
  pushed.

* What does a merge conflict look like
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
some source code...
<<<<<< HEAD
This is a change I made
==========
This is a change someone else made in the same place
that was already pushed to master
>>>>>> The hash of the other commit, something like fa54dd6f3...
The rest of the source that had not been touched
#+END_SRC
- When you pull changes that lead to a merge conflict git will notify which
  files have a merge conflict in them
- In each file, you'll see the above problem

* So how do we deal with this?
- One strategy is to just go through the file and manually reconcile the
  conflict. Often deleting the lines that git inserted is fine, but make sure
  both changes can coexist.
- After compiling your changes to make sure your code still compiles, you
  have to commit your merge resolution before being able to push your
  changes.
