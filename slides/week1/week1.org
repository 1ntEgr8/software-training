* Why are you here?
- Learn the basics of software development
- Get up to speed on technologies and techniques common to most RoboJackets teams

* Overview of Training
- Week 0 training (*Insert dates*)
- *TODO:* Anything we need to add here?

* The Linux terminal
- Powerful text-based interface for interacting with your computer
- (Almost) everything is a file or a folder
- It lets you navigate your folders and manipulate files quickly
- There are lots of tiny tools and commands you can use to do useful things

* ATTENTION WINDOWS USERS
- Terminal is not the same as Command Prompt
- You cannot use CMD as it has different commands than Linux
- Instead use Git bash
