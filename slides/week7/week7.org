* Data Structures
- Data structures are ways that computers store collections of data in memory
- Different data structures offer different advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency and grouping data

* Arrays
- You already have worked with arrays, which are the built in data structure for C++
- Elements of arrays are ordered and easily retrievable
- Arrays have a fixed size; maximum number of elements they can contain are determined when they are instantiated

* Lists
- A list is any data structure that is ordered
- Useful when relative ordering between elements is important
- There are various different implementations of lists in the C++ standard library

* Linked Lists
- Lists in which each data element is linked to the next element in the list
- The programmer has access to the list's "head" (the first element) and sometimes the "tail" (the last element)
- Disadvantages: retrieving elements in the middle of the list require starting at the head and then traversing the list until the desired element is found
- Advantages: easily resizable
